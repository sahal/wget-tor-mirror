<!-- BEGIN WARNING --> <div id="warning"> <h2>Want
Tor to really work?</a></h2> <p>You need to change some of your habits, as
some things won't work exactly as you are used to.</p> <ol> <li><b>Use the
Tor Browser</b> <p>Tor does not protect all of your computer's Internet
traffic when you run it. Tor only protects your applications that are
properly configured to send their Internet traffic through Tor. To
avoid problems with Tor configuration, we strongly recommend you use
the <a href="https://torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor
Browser</a>. It is pre-configured to protect your privacy and
anonymity on the web as long as you're browsing with the Tor Browser
itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be
unsafe to use with Tor.</p> </li> <li><b>Don't torrent over Tor</b>
<p> Torrent file-sharing applications have been observed to ignore
proxy settings and make direct connections even when they are told
to use Tor.  Even if your torrent application connects only through
Tor, you will often send out your real IP address in the tracker
GET request, because that's how torrents work. Not only do you <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea">
deanonymize your torrent traffic and your other simultaneous
Tor web traffic</a> this way, you also slow down the entire Tor
network for everyone else.  </p> </li> <li><b>Don't enable or
install browser plugins</b> <p>The Tor Browser will block browser
plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer, Quicktime, and others: they
can be manipulated into revealing your IP address. Similarly,
we do not recommend installing additional addons or plugins into
the Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your
anonymity and privacy. The lack of plugins means that Youtube videos
are blocked by default, but Youtube does provide an experimental
opt-in feature <a href="https://www.youtube.com/html5">(enable
it here)</a> that works for some videos.</p> </li> <li><b>Use
HTTPS versions of websites</b> <p>Tor will encrypt your traffic <a
href="https://torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#thesolution">to
and within the Tor network</a>, but the encryption of your traffic to
the final destination website depends upon on that website. To help
ensure private encryption to websites, the Tor Browser includes <a
href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>
to force the use of HTTPS encryption with major websites that
support it. However, you should still watch the browser URL bar to
ensure that websites you provide sensitive information to display a <a
href="https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Site%20Identity%20Button">blue
or green URL bar button</a>, include <b>https://</b>
in the URL, and display the proper expected name for
the website.  Also see EFF's interactive page explaining <a
href="https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https">how Tor and HTTPS
relate</a>.  </p> </li> <li><b>Don't open documents downloaded through Tor
while online</b> <p>The Tor Browser will warn you before automatically
opening documents that are handled by external applications. <b>DO NOT
IGNORE THIS WARNING</b>. You should be very careful when downloading
documents via Tor (especially DOC and PDF files) as these documents
can contain Internet resources that will be downloaded outside of
Tor by the application that opens them. This will reveal your non-Tor
IP address. If you must work with DOC and/or PDF files, we strongly
recommend either using a disconnected computer, downloading the free <a
href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and using it with a <a
href="http://virtualboxes.org/">virtual machine image</a> with networking
disabled, or using <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>.
Under no circumstances is it safe to use <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea">BitTorrent
and Tor</a> together, however.</p> </li> <li><b>Use bridges and/or
find company</b> <p>Tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what
destination websites you connect to. However, by default, it does not
prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from learning that you're
using Tor. If this matters to you, you can reduce this risk by configuring
Tor to use a <a href="https://torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en">Tor
bridge relay</a> rather than connecting directly to the
public Tor network. Ultimately the best protection is a social
approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more <a
href="https://torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en">diverse</a>
their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of
them. Convince other people to use Tor, too!</p> </li> </ol> <br>
<p>Be smart and learn more. Understand what Tor does and does not
offer.  This list of pitfalls isn't complete, and we need your help <a
href="https://torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en#Documentation">identifying
and documenting all the issues</a>.</p> </div> <!-- END WARNING -->
